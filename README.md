# Hand-Digit-Classification

- **Introduction**:
  - This project aims to solve a basic classification problem using the MNIST dataset. We utilized an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the task.

- **Dataset**:
  - We employed the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9, each represented as a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - **Layers**: The neural network comprises two hidden layers, each containing 128 units, with **ReLU** activation functions.
  - **Output Layer**: The output layer is a **linear** layer with 10 units, and the output is passed through the **softmax** function to obtain probabilities.

- **Training**:
  - The network was trained using the labeled MNIST data. The training process involved adjusting the network's parameters based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual label.

- **Performance**:
  - **Accuracy**: The trained model achieved an accuracy of **97.28999%** on the test dataset.
  - **Prediction**: The predicted digit is obtained by taking the argmax of the probability distribution generated by the softmax function.

This implementation serves as a basic demonstration of classification using Artificial Neural Networks.
